# Changelog

All notable changes to Khram are documented here. Edit the **`## [x.y.z]`** section for the version you are about to tag, then commit and push the tag (see `docs/releasing.md`).

The release workflow takes the section matching the tag (e.g. tag `v1.0.2` → heading `## [1.0.2]`) and uses it as the GitHub release description (plus auto-generated contributor/commit notes).
